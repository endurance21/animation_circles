PROJECT IDEA


1. ITS A CONTROLLED ANIMATION OF CIRCLES (MORE LOOKS LIKE A 2-D BALL).
2.I MADE IT USING CANVAS,JS,HTML,CSS.



PROJECT FEATURES
1.WE CAN CONTROLL RADIUS OF CIRCLES PARTICIPATING IN ANIMATION
2.WE CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE NO. OF CIRCLES  IN ANIMATION.( CAN HELP IN ANALIZING MOTION OF SINGLE ATOMS AND THOUSANDS AT SAME TIME). 
3.ALSO WE CAN CONTROLL SPEED MANUALLY ,MAKING THE ANIMATION MORE COOL AS PER DEMAND.

***************IT CAN BE USED IN SIMULATION OF processes,such as KTG (IN SHOWING MOVEMENT OF ATOMS AND THEIR RANDOM MOTION)****************
**************IT CAN ALSO BE USED MAKING ANIMATION FOR WEBPAGES ,LIKE BREZIUR CURVE USED IN WEBPAGE(BACKGROUND ANIMATION) OF SDS LAB*******
